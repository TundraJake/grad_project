# Stock Market Prediction using Neural Networks

## Resources

* Dataset - https://github.com/yumoxu/stocknet-dataset

## Timelime

* 2/26/20 - Finished getting data into dataframes. Next step is to format data to feed into neural networks. The step addresses issues from previous talk (normalization of data) and what happened to the Feed Forward Network.
* 3/3/20 - Finished the data_processor class and several other refactors. Now correctly normalizes data, writes the dataframe to a 'npy' file. Next step is to rebuilt and refactor the NN classes, then connect it to trader.py or something similar.
